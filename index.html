                          After sharing discussions with parents and our own experiences, we were surprised to find age as not being the primary determining factor in having an embodied digital diary experience. There were other limiting factors that disrupt embodiment, which stretch across the generation gap. 
                    </p>

                        <p>
These limiting factors include screen time, data usage, technical difficulty and mitigating affordances. The app in question, Dailybean, struck a balance allowing for maximum embodiment: low screentime requirement, no intrusive data being obtained, high level of use and accessibility affordances with massive implications for less able individuals.
                            
                    </p>

                    <p>
Embodiment was also affected by preconceptions of what diarising is, but this wasn’t restricted to a certain age group. Those of the older generation were willing to buy into a novel format just as much as the younger generation were dissuaded by it. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
Ultimately, the freshness of a new app wore off for all and more elements would need to be added for it to become a long-term habit.

The lack of social features of this app is one of the reasons why I might stop using it after our research is done."</p>

                                    <p>There has been much discussion on the issue of whether mobile apps will eliminate people’s self-expression. Eliminating self-expression can be identified as "when we don't express ourselves, we repress important parts of who we are and cause ourselves considerable struggle and lasting mental and emotional pain" (Stockton, 2019). </p>

                                    <p>
                                    <p>The expectation for me in this app, a university student, is to record my life at school, so that I reflect what I’ve done in the future. My observation lasts from Mar 7 to now. In the first place, I was interested with the design. Even I forgot to record my day, the reminder will remind me to record it. After 3 weeks, my feeling of freshness add passion in using this app started to reduce because of its single function, the ads when finish recording, and my single life. I don’t want to open the app, so my recoding frequency reduced from once a day to once a week. The app design is easy so there are no technical difficulties. Me personally didn’t feel intrusive because even I turn on the reminder, I will often forget to record my day since my sense of freshness passes away. There is no influence on me in the offline activities, because I feel what I did is for my own happiness but not for a nice recording data. Therefore, this app doesn’t play an important role that influencing my social activities. This app is more like a record than a encouragement. I tried to keep a offline diary before, but due to the heavy school work, my time can’t share any more time to it. The reminder would increase the anxiety for me. It reminded me that I didn’t finish writing the diary for my project for a few days. </p>
                                    </p>
                                    
                                     <strong style="background-color: yellowgreen">My Second Field Reflection </strong>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    <p>My feeling stays the same. I still can't get interested in DailyBean and I record it once a week. The function is simple so there is no new thing to explore. After using this app, it did have some effect on my mood, but it doesn’t affect my behaviours. The app will record what I exact experienced and what I think, therefore, I will still feel how I felt at that time when I look back. It’s also memorable in the future because part of my youth is recorded in the app. My expectation of this app is not high. I expect it will keep my experience only. The simple function didn’t give me further expectations. The symbol-function should be improved because they are not enough to represent my life. I’ll continue to find a new one with more functions. Moreover, I don’t have a concern about the release of data because the diary inside doesn’t include financial reports or political secrets. </p>

As a part of our research purposes, I paid a good amount of attention to my own experience of using DailyBean and how my interaction with it supports my self-expression. By storing my private information, this app keeps track of my everyday moods, feelings and activities. And by looking back at the data which shows how my mood was changing on a daily basis, my sense of time is also being amplified.

                                        <strong>My general thoughts and feelings: </strong> I started to use the app since the mid of March. At the very beginning, the app’s design and cute bean icons attracted me into using it everyday to record my moods. I used its diary function a lot and I even turned off the notification function for a while as I realised that I could always remember to use it before going to bed every night. After 1 to 2 weeks, it became one of my nightly routines. Even though I was not used to recording my days by writing down dairies either physically or digitally, this app made me realise it would be good to keep track of my everyday lives. Every time when I went back to the home page to see how my mood was flowing and changing day by day, I had a sense that this app was presenting a part of myself.
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>Any difficulties of using the app?  </strong> For me, one thing I don’t really like about this app is definitely its advertisements. It demotivated me to use it for a while. Even though the ads were all short, I still had to waste 5 seconds or more doing nothing and just watching the ads. I also complained about this by writing it down on the app’s diary section. 

                                    </p>

                                        <strong>Are you enjoying using the app? Is it giving you utility beyond just being a research project? </strong> Personally, I was enjoying using it, but just at the beginning. It allowed me to just “choose” instead of deciding on my own so that I didn’t need to take a lot of time thinking about what kind of things I would like to say about my day. But after a period, as the app started to show ads occasionally, I felt less satisfied with it. I might just end up using it after this research is done.

                                        <strong>Do you feel like the app is intrusive? Is the level of detail too much or too little? How willing are you to record this data on your phone?</strong> As a proficient user of all the digital devices and online platforms, I know I have to provide my personal information and my data for free in order to get some convenience sometimes. For me all the apps and platforms are intrusive, but they just don’t usually present themselves in that way. Same as Daily Bean, I knew that by uploading pictures to it or by writing my information down on it, it would have access to my personal data all the time. But on the other hand, I didn’t care much about it as long as I would be able to use it by accepting its terms and conditions. However, I still would not put too much of myself on it by uploading my selfies or by writing important notes down on it.

                                        <strong>Do you feel like it is changing your offline behaviour? </strong> No, for me this app was not as powerful as my other socialising apps on my phone which could make me change my offline behaviour (for example, using socialising apps like WeChat makes me stay connected with my friends and family all the time. It can significantly change my moods and feelings during the day). The primary function of this app is to record my day. And I can choose which icons to use to represent my mood on that day. I would not change my offline behaviour on the day in order to get a smiley bean face when I was using the app (to show that I was happy). Even though I did want to see more smiley faces appearing on my home page sometimes, I still wanted to just stick to how I felt instead of trying hard to force myself to be happy (this is not how I was using the app).

                                        <strong>Did you keep an offline diary before? If not why, and are you now using the app? If so, why? </strong> One interesting thing I found about myself through using this app was that I started to keep regular diary on it. This was something I never did when I didn’t have access to such digital platforms. I wrote offline diaries occasionally, but only when I felt down and needed a way to get rid of all the negative emotions. But after I turned on this app’s notification function, it reminded me to use it every time before I got to bed. This potentially changed my habit of not writing regular diaries and made me start to record my days no matter what I felt (linking back to the last question, I just realised that this might be the only thing in my life that the app actually had impact on). I did, however, occasionally chose not to use the app’s diary section as I didn’t know what to say about my day when I just stayed at my room all day doing nothing. I would definitely keep a record of those memorable events and people I met during the day on this app.

                                        <strong>Are you conscious about your screen time? Do you feel like using Daily Bean increases your screen time? Annoyed by notifications, or happy to be reminded to use the app? </strong> I did set up a screen time limitation for myself before, but it didn’t help me much, so I ended up turning if off. Even though I was still conscious about my screen time I paid less attention on how each app contributed to it. Using Daily Bean did not increase my screen time in my opinion, as I would also scroll through contents provided by other apps if I didn’t use it. Its notifications, sometimes, did annoy me, especially when I was using my phone for socialising purposes. I would ignore the notification for a while and used the app later.

                                        <strong>Do you feel less motivated to tell friends/family about your day, now that you are writing it in the app? Has it given you more of an opportunity to talk about your day, express your feelings? Has it made you less social?</strong> Somehow, yes. One of the reasons I talked to my friends and my family about my day was that I felt depressed or needed some suggestions/help from them regarding either my social or academic life. However, I accidentally noticed myself not talking to my friends about my feelings even though I went through a tough time on a day. The reason was I already used the app to record my day and I unconsciously assumed that “someone” had already knew about it. But it didn’t really make me less social as I would still remember to share some other important parts of my life that I did not want to just write down on the app with my friends.

                                        <strong>My general thoughts and feelings since the last time: </strong> So far, I have used Daily Bean for over a month. Because of its design and dairy function, I really liked this app at the beginning, but once that sense of freshness was gone after a few weeks of using it, I couldn’t really motivate myself into opening it, recording my moods by clicking on a few icons, and writing my thoughts down in words in the app’s diary section. Unlike other socialising apps installed in my phone, I felt this app was not really designed for a long-term use --- even though by tracking your data you might be able to get a stronger sense of time, or you might be able to be more aware of those memorable events happening in your life. But these didn’t offset the inconvenience this app brought to me. I was simply tired of watching ads and recording my holidays (yes the research was done in a holiday which might be one of the reasons why I simply didn’t want to work on or write anything even digitally). 
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>Do you think using the app over the last month has had an effect on your daily mood/behaviour?  </strong> Not really. As mentioned above, the app made me more aware of the memorable events that were happening in my daily lives. I would remind myself of writing these events down. I would not make an attempt to make myself happier simply because I wanted to see a smiley face appearing on the app’s home page on a certain day. So, this app didn’t really infiltrate into my everyday lives too much.

                                        <strong>What do you expect from a diary app? Which features would you need to be more invested in the app?</strong> One thing is definitely to make itself free. Ads were probably the major reasons why I wanted to stop using the app itself, even though its design and every other functions were performing really well. I also wanted to have the ability of designing my own icons, not just the ones the app offered.

                                        <strong> Would you continue to seek apps that perform a similar task but have the features that you desire? </strong> Probably not. As I don’t really have a habit of keeping diaries, I’m tired of using apps that have functions like this. Even though this app did motivate me for a small period of time to keep regular diary, I ended up losing a momentum of doing that after I was tired of using the app itself.

                                        <strong>Concerned about release of data?</strong> Yes. Most of the things I recorded on this app so far were pretty private. They might not be really important compared to other parts of my life that I would usually share with my friends or family, but they were things that I consider to be personal. My moods, my feelings, things happened on a day that made me happy or upset, they were significant to me and they all represent parts of me.

                                    <p>As for my mother, her expectation on this app is to understand her mood better and record what and how she did to lose weight. Her observation lasts from Mar 17 to Apr 6. From the beginning, she said the mood recording function can put her emotions in perspective. This app could push and encourage her to stay in a positive emotion. She also wrote reasons why she felt negative in the diary function. What exercise she did and what she ate are also recorded. However, she deleted the app because she found a more useful one. My mom is a businesswoman who pursue efficiency. The app she found contains more functions, including to-do list, reminder, diary and ext. She mentioned that the app function was single, and expected she can finish everything by opening only one app. Therefore, she deleted the app. She didn’t have the habit in writing a diary and the reason she continues using the old app is because of my research. When using daily bean, my mom didn’t put too much effort in using it. After using the new app, she was interested with the multifunction, so she spent more time in exploring the app. She said she still need time to get used to the app. As for the offline communication, my mom said she talked different things under different circumstance, so the app didn’t influence her offline communication. However, both new and old apps did give her a space to express herself, and they keep my mom’s words in secret. (see videos below that shows a part of my conversations with my mom. Note: I translated Cantonese to English)</p>

Since he used my old iPhone, because it’s not compatible with Android, to finish our observation, he didn’t put photos in. He is satisfied with this app because it’s a non-interactive app. He mentioned that he will continue to use this app if there are some more improvements. He mentioned that if the app can absorb the feedback from the users, he may want to continue using the app. He complained about the symbols in the app, so he expected to add more symbols according to the feedbacks from the users. My dad didn’t turn on the reminder because he didn’t know it. However, he keeps recording every day to make sure my project goes on well.</p>

                                    <p>My mom is using another app called Shi Guang Xu. She spoke highly of this new app, and she has seen this app as a lifestyle. The app can be briefly described as a mobile robot, which can enforce your life in a certain route. It includes a to-do list, lists of improvements, a schedule and ext. She put the app in a prominent place on the screen to remind her to record. She mentioned that she stopped recording so to explore and set up the functions in the app from last time, for example, when and how she will take medicine or go to work. The app influences her a lot. She said the app gives a platform to clarify what she wants and how she can get it. According to her screenshot, she decided to spend more time with family and call her parents at a certain frequency. She also did lots of things in the app and I will attach some screenshots. Combine with what she said, we can tell that she expects efficiency and regular life from this app. She will not find a new app because she is satisfied with this app. However, she would be concerned about the release of data because she did record some financial income or outcomes related to her company in the app. Our question raises her concern about the privacy of the app. Therefore, she will avoid recording some sensitive information in the app. For my mother, digital dualism affects her life to a large extend. She set the app in the center of the screen to remind her offline activities. (see video below that shows a part of my conversations with my mom. Note: I translated Cantonese to English)</p>

                                    <p>There’s not too much new feeling for my dad on DailyBean. He said the app doesn’t influence his life and mood for these few days. The reason for this is that he didn’t place the app in an important place. He expects to record his life only. He won’t seek a new diary app because he doesn’t have the habit to keep a diary, at least at this stage. He still doesn’t concern about the release of data because he just records his normal life. Also, he doesn’t think he is anyone important that someone will need his data. (see video below that shows a part of my conversations with my dad.

<strong style="background-color: yellowgreen">Comparisons between Hazel and her parents</strong>

        There is a common point we all had mentioned. First, the symbols in DailyBean can’t fully represent our daily activities. For example, when my dad drank tea, he could only find drinks/coffee in the blank. Our family didn’t use the symbols a lot. Second, DailyBean is not important enough to influence our family members’ daily route. The reason for this can be summarized into three. First, there are no consequences if we don’t record it under a non-research purpose. Second, there’s no reward for doing certain activities. Third, we position the app into a non-important thing. It’s just a recorder rather than an encouragement.  Fourth, digital dualism separates highly when our family uses Dailybean. There are no differences when using Dailybean currently due to its easy function. I’ll compare my mom’s new app and Dailybean. So far, my period conclusion is that there is no generation difference can be clearly found through one month’s observation. It can be counted as the old generation (70s-80s) uses phones frequently and catches up the information easily. Also, there are some hints when interviewing that the app is not functional enough to eliminate our self-expression. Furthermore, both for me and my mom somehow would forget to record things on it after the sense of freshness passes away. That’s the reason why Plato would say writing destroy memories. Our expectation on this app doesn’t play an important role in our life.

It didn’t take me much time to navigate through it, to learn how to record my days just by clicking on those few tabs. One thing I really liked about it was I didn’t need to write anything, that is, the app already presented all the options for you so all you needed to do was to choose which icon could best represent your day instead of describing it in words. However, at the same time, the options it presented there were quite limited: your feeling, weather, meal, social lives, activities, romance…and that’s all. Everything was pre-designed, so it didn’t give me any opportunities to record some other parts of my life.”

                                        <strong>Are you enjoying using the app? Is it giving you utility beyond just being a research project? </strong> “I can say I did. It has a strong practicability. At lease I could go back to see how I felt or what I wrote down on previous days.”

                                        <strong>Do you feel like the app is intrusive? Is the level of detail too much or too little? How willing are you to record this data on your phone?</strong> “I don’t really feel this app is intrusive. But in my personal opinion, it might be better for it to allow the users set up and enter their passwords before they can use the app. Also, one thing I don’t really like about the app is there are too many options (too many icons to choose from) which did not really suit my need. As I said, sometimes I would like to record some other parts of my life by just clicking on icons, but it turns out that all the options/icons were predefined. And these predefined icons could not really say anything that I wanted to say about my day. And I didn’t use all the options presented on it. Personally, I don’t have many doubts on whether the app is going to steal my personal data if I record things on it, I still feel safe using my phone to keep track of my data. But on another level, as I just mentioned before, it’s better to let users enter their passwords before using the app.”

                                        <strong>Do you feel like it is changing your offline behaviour? </strong> “Not really. The influence was quite subtle I should say. Even though sometimes I might think: oh, I must remember to record this thing on the app, this is quite interesting. But it didn’t change my offline behaviour, it just made me more aware of those interesting and funny things happened during the day because I would sometimes consciously remind myself of writing them down on the app after those things happened.”

If so, why? </strong> “I didn’t really have the habit of keeping diaries. Even though I did occasionally keep diaries when I was in college but that didn’t form a habit. I sometimes thought it was unnecessary and I was also a bit concerned about privacy, because you know, offline diaries, some people might be able to see them as well. While I’m carrying my phone all the time, I’m become less reluctant to write diaries on this app.”

Annoyed by notifications, or happy to be reminded to use the app? </strong> “I am actually super conscious about my screen time. It’s essential to set a limitation for yourself. This app didn’t take me much time though so I would be willing to use it every day. Its notifications were actually quite useful for me, as I would like to be reminded to do it other than memorizing it myself.”

Has it given you more of an opportunity to talk about your day, express your feelings? Has it made you less social?</strong> “It didn’t make me less social. Actually, things that I recorded on this app were mainly about how I felt, but I would always remember to talk to my family or friends about some more important things happening in my life, such as my work and my social lives.”

So I can only use this app on my iPad which is not that convenient for me. You know, it goes back to the problem I talked about before. I’m concerning more about my privacy if I can’t carry my diaries with me all the time, and that’s why I don’t really have a habit of keeping diaries. If I can download this app on my phone, that would actually be much better for me to use this app without any worries. Another thing is I think, as users we should have more freedom of making options of which parts of our lives we want to record. You know, even though by choosing between icons might be a lot easier but I still think this app should leave a space for those who just wanted to design their own choices.”

I don’t use many apps actually and this app didn’t really take me a lot of time every day so why not just keep using it to record some simple stuff or some things that I might forget?

                                        <strong>Ashley: </strong> It’s actually quite interesting to see how my parents’ embodiment experience of using this app is similar but also kind of different from mine. We all complained about the predefined options the app presents, and thought it would be great if we could design our own icons to represent our daily activities. My dad also stated how he thought the app was “easy to use” because the only thing you need is to make a choice (even though the options presented are far more than actually needed). I had the same feeling as well. One thing different about us was my dad seemed to concern less about his privacy when he was using this app (he even said offline diaries made him concern more about his privacy because if you accidentally lose your dairy notebook for example, people might be able to see everything you wrote down there). And because he is using his phone all the time, he always remembers to carry it with him, but there is no way that he carries a big dairy notebook with him all the time in order not to let other people read the content. While for me, I was more aware of how my personal data might be used and stored by this app, though I still didn’t really feel those data were of any importance to me. My dad, at the same time, were quite concerned about his screen time, even when he was using the app which might only took him about 10 minutes per day. As a more proficient user of all the digital devices, I used my phone all the time so I just couldn’t be as self-disciplined as my dad to set up a limitation for myself. In addition, as for both of us, our social lives were not influenced much by this app. And same as my dad, I sometimes would choose to share more important things with my friends/family rather than writing them down on this app. For me, I only used this app to record my moods and feelings day by day.

                                        <strong>How does your relationship with your parents might influence the research result? </strong> My parents were very cooperative during the whole process. When I interviewed them, it seemed that I was able to understand the hidden meaning of their words because of our intimate relationship. I could always get a rough idea of what they were trying to say, even though their answer to a question was often ambiguous. Interestingly, until now my parents have never taken an initiative to share their diary on the app with me unless I asked them to do so. And because I told them ahead of time that I was doing research, their responses might be more genuine than those of other people that I didn't know before. But on the other hand, our relationship was also the reason that they were willing to change their behaviour in order to let me get a good research result: my father, for example, even if he did not have a habit of keeping a diary, he used the app in order to let me finish the research and he turned on the reminder function of the app to remind himself that he had to use the software every night.
